# binarybot-public
Collection of Binary.com bots from the web. These are mostly bots found while experimenting and playing with binary.com. I would not recommend any of them, especially anything with a Martingale. Never run on a live account without checking on a demo account first.

Remember these rules:
If it has a Martingale it's not profitable in the long run and is gambling
If someone says you shouldn't be "greedy" and only run a bot for a short period, it means its not profitable and will wipe your profits.


# CAPITAL AT SERIOUS RISK!!!!
Please don't use these bots in anything but virtual account.
